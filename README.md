# RAG-time Chat Client

This is a "talk to your textbook" style chatbot, employing a RAG-system with the Fanshawe College SOAR student success handbook as an example text. You can try it out at: [https://rag-time-production.up.railway.app/](https://rag-time-production.up.railway.app/).

Note that this chatbot uses GPT-3.5-Turbo for completions (equivalent to the free version of ChatGPT) and will resist off-topic queries, so there's no point in trying to use it for purposes other than those for which it was intended.
